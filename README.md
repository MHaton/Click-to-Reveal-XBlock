# Click-to-reveal-XBlock
A basic XBlock to reveal some HTML when a button element is clicked. Originally an Open edX 2016 Hackathon project.

Available fields: 
- 'Show' action name (such as 'Reveal', 'Click to' or 'Show')
- 'Hide' action name (such as 'Close', 'Click to' or 'Hide')
- Text Label (such as 'Comment', 'Description' or 'Text') - This displays both on the button and as a heading above the text
- Heading level (for the text label in the revealed text)
- Reveal text (the text to reveal)

This is to try and make the way the button displays as customisable as possible. It defaults to 'Reveal Comment' and 'Hide Comment'.
